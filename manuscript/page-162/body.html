<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>PETKOFF (genially). That's all right. (He sneezes. "Go and ask your mistress for my coat, like a good girl, will you? (She turns to obey; but Nicola enters with the coat; and she makes a pretence of having business in the room by taking the little table with the hookah away to the wall near the windows.)")</p><p>RAINA (rising quickly, as she sees the coat on Nicola's arm). Here it is, papa. Give it to me, Nicola; and do you put some more wood on the fire. (She takes the coat, and brings it to the Major, who stands up to put it on. Nicola attends to the fire.)</p><p>PETKOFF (to Raina, teasing her affectionately). Aha! Going to be very good to poor old papa just for one day after his return from the wars, eh?</p><p>RAINA (with solemn reproach). Ah, how can you say that to me, father?</p><p>PETKOFF. Well, well, only a joke, little one. Come, give me a kiss. (She kisses him. "Now give me the coat.")</p></div> </div>
