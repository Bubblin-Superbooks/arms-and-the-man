Swiss, madam, I think.</p><p>CATHERINE (with a bound that makes Louka jump back). Swiss! What is he like?</p><p>LOUKA (timidly). He has a big carpet bag, madam.</p><p>CATHERINE. Oh, Heavens, he's come to return the coat! Send him away—say we're not at home—ask him to leave his address and I'll write to him—Oh, stop: that will never do. Wait! (She throws herself into a chair to think it out. Louka waits. "The master and Major Saranoff are busy in the library, aren't they?")</p><p>LOUKA. Yes, madam.</p><p>CATHERINE (decisively). Bring the gentleman out here at once. (Imperatively. "And be very polite to him. Don't delay. Here (impatiently snatching the salver from her): leave that here; and go straight back to him.")</p><p>LOUKA. Yes, madam. (Going.)</p></div> </div>
