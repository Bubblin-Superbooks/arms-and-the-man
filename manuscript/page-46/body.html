It's running away with him, of course: do you suppose the fellow wants to get there before the others and be killed? Then they all come. You can tell the young ones by their wildness and their slashing. The old ones come bunched up under the number one guard: they know that they are mere projectiles, and that it's no use trying to fight. The wounds are mostly broken knees, from the horses cannoning together.</p><p>RAINA. Ugh! But I don't believe the first man is a coward. I believe he is a hero!</p><p>MAN (goodhumoredly). That's what you'd have said if you'd seen the first man in the charge to-day.</p></div> </div>
