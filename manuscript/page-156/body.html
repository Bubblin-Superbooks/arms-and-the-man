<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>BLUNTSCHLI (apologetically). Quite true, quite true. I always was that sort of chap. I'm very sorry. But now that you've found that life isn't a farce, but something quite sensible and serious, what further obstacle is there to your happiness?</p><p>RAINA (riling). You are very solicitous about my happiness and his. Do you forget his new loveâ€”Louka? It is not you that he must fight now, but his rival, Nicola.</p><p>SERGIUS. Rival!! (Striking his forehead.)</p><p>RAINA. Did you not know that they are engaged?</p><p>SERGIUS. Nicola! Are fresh abysses opening! Nicola!!</p><p>RAINA (sarcastically). A shocking sacrifice, isn't it? Such beauty, such intellect, such modesty, wasted on a middle-aged servant man! Really, Sergius, you cannot stand by and allow such a thing. It would be unworthy of your chivalry.</p></div> </div>
